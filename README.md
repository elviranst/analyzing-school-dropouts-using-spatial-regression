# Description
In this study, I applied spatial regression to analyze the factors influencing school dropout rates in North Sumatra using R studio and ArcGIS (for enhancing map visualization)
- The spatial weight matrices used are queen, rook, and bishop.
- The spatial regression approaches employed are SAR and SEM.

# Source of Data
Secondary data collected from Badan Pusat Statistik and Geospatial Indonesia containing 33 cities in North Sumatra

# The results
The best model used in this case is the spatial error model with queen contiguity spatial weight matrices
